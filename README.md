# Procedural-Perlin-Terrain
A Javascript + HTML test program that generates "infinite" procedural terrain using perlin noise, and displays it on the web page in 2D or as an isometric projection.

Please note that this is a work in progress, and as such, may not be super optimized right now.

Feel free to mess around with it!

### Features:
* You can input a world seed
* You can input offset coordinates, or drag the map around with your cursor
* You can toggle between 2D/Isometric view
* Multiple world generation settings (octaves, wavelength, exponent, water level etc)

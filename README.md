# Procedural-Perlin-Terrain
A Javascript + HTML test program that generates "infinite" procedural terrain using perlin noise, and displays it on the web page as an isometric projection.

Please note that it is likely severely unoptimized and entirely unorganized right now.

But feel free to mess around with it!

### Features:
* You can input a world seed
* You can input offset coordinates, or drag the map around with your cursor
* You can toggle between 2D/Isometric view
* Multiple world generation settings (octaves, wavelength, etc)
* Factor value is the same as maximum world height
